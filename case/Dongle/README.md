# Dongle enclosure 

This type of enclosure is built around LilyGO&#174; & SoftRF [**T-Motion**](https://github.com/lyusupov/SoftRF/wiki/Dongle-Edition#required) LoRaWAN GNSS tracker board.<br>

**NOTICE**: This design is applicable for revision V1.1 (pre-production sample) of the T-Motion. Other revisions may or may not match.

# Exterior

It is recommended to start with 'Slim' variant of the design.<br>
It has almost no space for 'extras'. However it gives an access to the board pin headers and BOOT button.<br>
