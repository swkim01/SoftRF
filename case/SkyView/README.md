# Instructions

Choose an appropriate **Body** STL file based upon your measured battery dimensions:
* **Body** is to fit for reference 62x35x6 mm battery, or
* **Body-plus** - it has +1 mm increase for height and width of battery compartment.

3D print two STL files from this folder: **Body**(-plus) and **Face**. You may pick some printing advisories on [my Thingiverse page](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3702447).<br>
If you are unable to print the parts by yourself - you may consider to find an appropriate local 3D service provider and place an order with assistance of [Treatstock](http://www.treatstock.com) or [3DHubs](http://www.3dhubs.com/) portals.

Fasten the T5S board to the enclosure's main body with four 2.5x10 mm screws.
Put face plate on top of the assembly.

# Speaker mount option

3D print **Speaker** STL file from this folder.<br>

Put 40 mm speaker inside the printed mount.<br>
Fasten the mount to the enclosure's main body with four 2.5x8 mm screws.
